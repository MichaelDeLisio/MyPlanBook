## Auto-load Monthly Transactions  - User Story #1

As a frequent debit card and credit card user, I would like to be able to quickly load monthly or weekly transactions I've made into my financial planner as to avoid manually inputing every transaction myself. This allows me to avoid spending a long time inputing all my debit/credit history as well
as avoiding linking my banking account to the application (which could reveal sensitive personal information).

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Process csv files provided by banking institutions.
- Allow for manual categorization of transactions.
- Allow for manual entry of transactions as well.

## Time Management Planner - User Story #2

I would like to be able to add any assessments/things that I need to do in order to keep myself organized, and get updates on my phone to remind me to do them. This allows me to keep myself organized and not forget to do anything I need to do.

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Allow to update as many due dates as I need.
- Send SMS text message updates whenever the user wants the updates to be sent.

## Financial Goal Function - User Story #3

I would like to be able to set a financial goal for myself, such as saving for an item that I want to purchase, and have the ability to input money I've earned and money I've spent to guage how close I am to my goal. This allows me to have a better understanding of how close I am to saving the amount of money necessary to buy the item.

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Allow users to input money earned/gained, and having the "goal amount" decreasing (since we are closer to the goal)
- Allow users to input any expendatures, and having the "goal amount" increase (since we are farther from the goal)

## Login - User Story #4

I would like to be able to make an account and having the program ask for my name, email, and phone number, and also remembering them. This allows me to have the program personalized, and also having the ability for the program to send me notifications.

**Criteria of Satisfaction**

- Allow for login/signup 
- Having the user to enter their full name, and options for their name and number

## Planner Selector - User Story #5

Since we have different kinds of planning functions (i.e. financial and time management planner), I would like to have a main page where I would be able to choose which function to access. This would allow me to have a simple way of accessing the different functions.

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- A page with different buttons and each button takes you to the requested function

## Summary Page - User Story #6

I would like to have a summary page where I would be able to see the most recent updates from each of my planners in one page without having to click through each.

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Allow users to access a page where they can view a summary of updates for each planner in a single page
