## Auto-load Monthly Transactions  - User Story #1

As a frequent debit card and credit card user, I would like to be able to quickly load monthly or weekly transactions I've made into my financial planner as to avoid manually inputing every transaction myself. This allows me to avoid spending a long time inputing all my debit/credit history as well
as avoiding linking my banking account to the application (which could reveal sensitive personal information).

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Process csv files provided by banking institutions.
- Allow for manual categorization of transactions.
- Allow for manual entry of transactions as well.

## Time Management Planner - User Story #2

I would like to be able to add any assessments/things that I need to do in order to keep myself organized, and get updates on my phone to remind me to do them. This allows me to keep myself organized and not forget to do anything I need to do.

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Allow to update as many due dates as I need.
- Send SMS text message updates whenever the user wants the updates to be sent.

## Financial Goal Function - User Story #2

I would like to be able to set a financial goal for myself, such as saving for an item that I want to purchase, and have the ability to input money I've earned and money I've spent to guage how close I am to my goal. This allows me to have a better understanding of how close I am to saving the amount of money necessary to buy the item.

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Allow users to input money earned/gained, and having the "goal amount" decreasing (since we are closer to the goal)
- Allow users to input any expendatures, and having the "goal amount" increase (since we are farther from the goal)
