## Auto-load Monthly Transactions  - User Story #1

As a frequent debit card and credit card user, I would like to be able to quickly load monthly or weekly transactions I've made into my financial planner as to avoid manually inputing every transaction myself. This allows me to avoid spending a long time inputing all my debit/credit history as well
as avoiding linking my banking account to the application (which could reveal sensitive personal information).

**Criteria of Satisfaction**
- Process csv files provided by banking institutions.
- Allow for manual categorization of transactions.
- Allow for manual entry of transactions as well.
