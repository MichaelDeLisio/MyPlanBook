# Creative Brief
## Project Objective
Build an all-in-one multi-planner tool for planning and managing various aspects of one’s life: 
health, fitness, education, deadlines, bucket lists, finances, social endeavours, and potentially others.

The goal is to build at least 3 main planning tools:
1) A health and fitness planner for managing workouts, calories, weight, and bodyfat percentage.
2) A calendar planning tool for managing deadlines and to-do lists.
3) A financial management tool for managing budgets, transactions, savings, and more.

## Key Personas
### Persona 1
Jessica – a busy 20-year-old university student at Harvard who participates in various 
extra-curricular activities, is a personal trainer at Harvard’s gym, and plays in Harvard's intramural basketball league.
With so many commitments, Jessica finds it difficult to keep track of those commitments throughout the school year.
In addition, Jessica lives on campus and has a limited budget which she needs to manage carefully lest she
overspend and run out of money.
### Persona 2
Kimberly – a busy nurse and single mother of three children. Kimberly has trouble managing her 
family duties and her personal finances. Her teen children who are all in high school 
have a difficult time remembering their scheduled activities, events, and deadlines.
As a result, Kimberly is in desperate need of a management and planning tool for both herself and her children.

## Key Scenarios
### Scenario 1
Jessica needs to create her personal workout plans for the week as well as workout plans 
for her clients. In addition, Jessica is working on a big school project that 
is due next week and needs to be presented. More than that, she needs to attend several basketball practices this week
before her big game on Friday. Clearly, Kimberly has a lot on her plate and needs a quality planning tool to manage her
scheduled commitments.
### Scenario 2
Kimberly has a very busy workweek at the hospital this week: needing to attend to various clients and stay overtime. 
In addition, Kimberly has a lot of bills she’s forgotten to pay and the interest is accumulating because she has been so busy and consequently
disorganized. Furthermore, her children have several scheduled sports practices and doctor's appointments this week. 
Not only that, but Kimberly has realized that she needs to start
managing her budget in a better manner so that she can start saving more for her children's college tuitions.
As such, Kimberly has an ever growing need to organize and manage her schedule and finances.  

## Key Principles
### Principle 1
Functionality first – then aesthetics. Each planner should plan and manage what it is expected to plan 
and manage first and foremost. Visual graphics as part of the GUI to attract a user’s attention can be 
enhanced later.
### Principle 2
Simplicity and intuition. The use of the GUI multi-planning tool should be intuitive and simple.
There should be no hidden features that the non-tech-savvy user would struggle to uncover.
