# Creative Brief
## Project Objective
Build an all-in-one multi-planner tool for planning and managing various aspects of one’s life: 
health, fitness, education, deadlines, bucket lists, finances, social endeavours, and potentially others.

The goal is to build at least 3 main planning tools:
1) A health and fitness planner for managing workouts, calories, weight, and bodyfat percentage.
2) A calendar planning tool for managing deadlines and to-do lists
3) A financial management tool

## Key Personas
### Persona 1
Jessica – a busy 20-year-old university student at Harvard who participates in various 
extra-curricular activities and is also a personal trainer at Harvard’s gym.
### Persona 2
Kimberly – a busy nurse who is a member of a book club. Kimberly has trouble managing her 
personal finances.

## Key Scenarios
### Scenario 1
Jessica needs to create her personal workout plans for the week as well as workout plans 
for her clients. Several new clients have signed up for Jessica’s personal training sessions: 
clients she needs to account for. In addition, Jessica is working on a big school project that 
is due next week and needs to be presented. 
### Scenario 2
Kimberly has been reading several novels and textbooks. She’s currently learning quantum mechanics, 
geography, electronics, and Linux programming from textbooks. However, Kimberly got so invested in a novel 
that she forgot to mark the pages of her textbooks where she last left off: leaving the textbooks to continue 
reading her novel. In addition, Kimberly has a lot of bills she’s forgotten to pay and the interest is accumulating. 

## Key Principles
### Principle 1
Functionality first – then aesthetics. Each planner should plan and manage what it is expected to plan 
and manage first and foremost. Visual graphics as part of the GUI to attract a user’s attention can be 
enhanced later.
### Principle 2
Simplicity and intuition. The use of the GUI multi-planning tool should be intuitive and simple.
There should be no hidden features that the non-tech-savvy user would struggle to uncover.
