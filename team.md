## Agile Meetings
- Meet and discuss project in person during and after CSC301 tutorials
- In person meetings somewhere in IB
- Most communication will occur online
 
## Meeting Preparation
- Bring a list of significant issues, suggestions for improvement, and other project matters
- Bring new user stories or features for the next sprint

## Git Version Control
- For the most part, each commit should add a major functionality to the project
- For each commit, add a commit message which summarizes the code changes (what, why, and possibly how)
- Commits should be atomic (one) and standalone (independent of other commits) as much as possible 

## Roles and Work Division
- Divide user stories by front-end/ back-end
- Divide user stories by categories (group similar features together)

## Sprint Deliverable Submissions
- ? will review and submit sprint deliverables

## Contingency Plan
- If a group member drops the course, divide remaining user stories equally among group members
- If a group member fails to contribute what was asked of the group member, give the member a second chance (people get busy, have tests, and have other priorities)
- If a group member continuously fails to contribute adequately, remind the group member of the peer evaluation reports:
how the group member's mark will suffer (reiterate the consequences)
- If a team member is academically dishonest, report the matter immediately so that the whole group does not suffer potential academic penalties
