## Practices to Continue During Next Sprint ##
- Use of ticket numbers as branch names and for commit prefixes.
- Pull requests made on each potential merge to the master branch.
- Group discussion on significant design decisions.
- Creating user stories that are logically independant from each other.

## New Practices for Next Sprint ##
- Practicing civility and brevity when communicating with team members.
- Conform to a consistent GUI design (theme); appoint member responsible for UI design.
- Utilize a variety of common object oriented design patterns.
- Everyone independantly and actively tracking their own user stories & subsequent sub-tasks on JIRA.

## Harmful Practices ##
- Starting development without reading sprint 1 guidelines/rubric. This resulted in a considerable amount of time being allocated to revisions that could have been prevented.
- Disproportional division of user stories into subtasks, in certain cases.
- Inconsistent design across multiple GUI views.
- Relying on other team members to track and update progress for their sub-tasks on JIRA.

## Best/ Worse Experiences During Sprint 1 ##
-	Worst: dealing with small bugs that wasted a lot of time, not being able to open the project properly (as a result of complicated gradle configuration files).
-	Best: Getting our application to run properly and display all the features in a timely fashion.
