# Sprint 1 Planning Meeting

**Sprint Goal**: The goal is to start working on each planner in the multi-planner tool, set up a main menu to gain access to each planner, and get the features: *Log In* and *Sign Up* working to access the main menu screen via an account.
So, the user stories *Log In* and *Sign Up* will be completed for Sprint 1 in so far as the corresponding features allow a mock log in function and a mock sign up function while the app is running. However, this login data will not be stored permanently: it is temporary to the application session.
More permanent data storage which persists even after closing the app will be implemented as a user story in later sprints. 
The last user story to be completed in Sprint 1 is *Select Main Menu Items* which will allow the user to select their desired planner, select the settings page, and select the password change form.
Also, we will discuss the system design at a high level and the framework of the code base as a group.
