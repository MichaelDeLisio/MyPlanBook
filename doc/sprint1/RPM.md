# Release Planning Meeting
## Release Goal

Overall, our goal is to release a fully functional multi-planner mobile app with a sleek design by the end of the last sprint. 
Our group has named this multi-planner tool “My Plan Book”. We expect to release this multi-planner tool with three different planning 
tools: a calendar planner for tracking deadlines, a health and fitness planner, and lastly a financial planner for managing one’s finances 
or budgeting. Aside from these planning tools, the addition of a new type of planner will depend on whether or not new planners are within 
scope: manageable and easy to implement in addition to our existing features.

## Scope

In terms of the main features of our software project, the software project can be divided into four main categories: general features, the calendar, the health and fitness planner, and finally the financial planner. General features include logins, profiles, settings, screens for selecting planners, and other general application features. Next, the main functionalities of the calendar will include the ability to select a date from a calendar, the ability to add new tasks for a selected date, and the ability to remove tasks for a selected date.

Then, we plan on having four main features for the health and fitness planner: the ability to log your body weight for various dates, the ability to log your daily caloric intake, the ability to calculate and log your body fat percentage, and finally the ability to log your workouts on selected dates. Lastly, in terms of the features of the financial planner, the main features we plan on implementing include the ability to log and track transactions from imported csv files, the ability to set and track savings goals, the ability to see graphical representations of one’s financial data, and finally the ability to log one’s purchase wish list and expenditures. But one more thing, we plan on having more permanent data storage by using a database instead of having temporary data which gets deleted upon the application’s restart.
