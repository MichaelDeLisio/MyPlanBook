# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting

**Sprint Goal**: The goal is to begin implementing the primary tools and functionalities for each planner. Also, we wish to gather a better understanding of the Firebase interface for Android applications.
This sprint should provide a framework for building the model classes and communication classes that will integrate the database and address persistent data storage that at the moment has not been implemented.
The main issues that this sprint will focus on are the calendarize deadlines interface, completion of the financial hub main view, the log body weight functionality in the health & fitness planner and the user profile page. Finally, we will continue a dialogue on the system design at a high level and the framework of the code base as a team.
