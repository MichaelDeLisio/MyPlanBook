## User Story Points Series for Complexity Estimation
We used the Fibonacci sequence from the lecture slides of week 3 to estimate the complexity of each user story with the values in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8} where 8 indicates the greatest complexity and 0 indicates the lowest complexity. We used the planning poker method to decide and agree on common point estimates as a team for each user story. These values are recorded on Jira.

## Priority Values
We assigned the following ordered priority values to the user stories: highest, high, medium, low, and lowest where ‘highest’ is the highest priority value, and ‘lowest’ is the lowest priority value. These values are recorded on Jira.
