## Practices to Continue During Next Sprint ##
- Adherence to branch naming conventions.
- Pull requests made on each potential merge to the master branch.
- Group discussion on significant design decisions.

## New Practices for Next Sprint ##
- Appoint a member responsible for standarizing the UI and maintaining consistency throughout the App's graphical components.
- Introduce new design patterns recently learned.
- Everyone should independently and actively track their own user stories & subsequent sub-tasks on JIRA from the start date.
- Begin earlier and make consistent commits over the entire period rather than clustering commits near the deadline.

## Harmful Practices ##
- Inconsistent design across multiple GUI views.
- Not managing tasks on JIRA until the very end of the sprint.
- Bad code design: poor naming conventions, violation of single responsibility principle, no javadoc/comments.

## Best/ Worse Experiences During Sprint 3 ##
- Worst: dealing with complex merge conflicts hours before the demo.
- Best: being considerably more organized and efficient compared to last sprint.
